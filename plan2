1. No Data Layer (Critical)
   - No repository pattern
   - No data models

   - No ViewModel or similar pattern
   - No business logic separation
3. No DI Container
   - Manual dependency injection in Composables
   - Hard to test and scale
4. Large Screen Files
   - HomeScreen.kt: 696 lines
   - OtherProfileScreen.kt: 418 lines
   - Should be broken into smaller components
5. No Architecture Pattern
