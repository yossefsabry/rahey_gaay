Rahey-Gaay application plan

Goals
- Build a scalable, multi-page travel app with a strong design system.
- Support light/dark themes and English/Arabic (RTL/LTR) experiences.
- Keep UI consistent, performant, and easy to extend.

Design system
- Single source of truth for colors, typography, spacing, corner radius, and shadows.
- Central theme module: light/dark palettes, button styles, card styles, gradients.
- Brand name/logo loaded from .env and exposed via BuildConfig.

Architecture
- UI package structure:
  - ui/theme (colors, typography, shapes)
  - ui/components (buttons, cards, inputs, section headers)
  - ui/screens (Home, Map, Support, Auth, Profile, Info)
  - ui/navigation (routes, bottom bar, nav graph)
- Shared state: simple UI state classes per screen; no network integration yet.

Screens to deliver (from pages.txt)
- Core: Home, Map, Support/Chat, Login/Register, User Profile, Other User Profile.
- Info pages (template-based): Company, About, Careers, Press, Blog, Support, Help Center,
  Safety Center, Community, Contact, Terms of Service, Privacy Policy.

Navigation
- Bottom bar: Home, Map, Support, Profile, More.
- Stack navigation for detail pages and login/register flows.

UX requirements
- Buttons: press feedback (scale/alpha ripple), consistent radius and shadows.
- Links: real navigation targets, no dead buttons.
- Loading: startup loading screen + page skeletons for content.
- Keyboard handling: use insets so inputs remain visible when the keyboard appears.

Localization and RTL
- English + Arabic strings.
- RTL layout direction when Arabic is active.
- Mirror icon/text placement where needed.

Performance
- Keep dependencies minimal.
- Avoid heavy recompositions and large image loads.
- Use lazy lists for large content.

Milestones
1) Theme + brand config (colors, fonts, logo, app name from .env).
2) Navigation scaffolding + bottom bar.
3) Implement Home screen UI (design-based welcome/home).
4) Implement remaining screens and info templates.
5) Add localization, RTL, and loading states.
6) UI polish: button effects, spacing, and accessibility.
